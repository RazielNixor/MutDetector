README-MutFail() and formatPage()

WELCOME ALL!

This program is designed to use formatPage() to accept a sequence of nucleotides and format
the information into a string sequence of just the nucleotides which it outputs to a text
file where the program is located. From there you can copy and paste the nucleotide sequence
into the MutFail() programs input. MutFail accepts a reference text file of genes with
corresponding names and sequences which it sorts and prints the gene names as options to
test your input sequence against. The program will analyze the sequences and print out a 
report on the nucleotide mutation locations. If the majority of the sequence is found to be
mutated in consecutive order it, this indicates a deletion or insertion mutation which explains
the unexpected shift in the sequence.
